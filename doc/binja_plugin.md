# Binary Ninja plugin

The Binary Ninja plugin has a number of quirks. High level VMs like Dalvik are very complex, banjo leaves a lot unimplemented, and VM languages are not the primary use-case of Binary Ninja.

You have to select "disassembly" view. High Level IL and other IL views will just show "undefined".
